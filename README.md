# React Portfolio

## Description

In this assignment we were challenged to build a portfolio using React to showcase projects we have completed.

## Installation

To install this app, the user will need to open a terminal at the root of the app. In the CLI the user should type `npm install`, followed by `npm run build`, followed by `npm start`. This will launch the portfolio landing page in a new tab where the user can browse the website.

## Usage

Here's a screenshot of the deployed application's landing page:
![Portfolio Landing Page](<./public/portfolio.png>)

The website can be accessed using this link:

## Credits

Various activities from Module 20 were as guide.

Tutor Wesley Clements assisted me with writing the onSubmit function in the Contact.jsx file.
